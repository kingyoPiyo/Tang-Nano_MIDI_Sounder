@W: MT529 :"d:\documents\github\tang-nano_midi_sounder\src\uart_rx.v":47:4:47:9|Found inferred clock Gowin_PLL|clkoutd_inferred_clock which controls 98 sequential elements including UART_Rx_inst.bitCounter_reg[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
